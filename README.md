## Introduction
This is a work in progress proof of concept to demonstrate private comments on Ethereum, using Semaphore.

Users can register to comment on any ERC-20 or ERC-721 token, providing they are a holder of that token, and then comment anonymously.

## Getting Started

1. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
